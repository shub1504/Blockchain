##  3. `ACD.sol` – **Role-Based Academic Data Access**

### Description:
This contract enforces access control where only registrars can assign faculty roles, and only faculty members can register learners. The registrar can also remove learner records.

### Key Functions:
- `authorizeFaculty(address _faculty)` – Registrar assigns faculty roles.
- `registerLearner(string memory _fullName, uint _idNumber)` – Faculty registers a learner.
- `viewLearner(uint _idNumber)` – View learner profile.
- `removeLearner(uint _idNumber)` – Registrar removes a learner.

##  4. `EVS.sol` – **Ether Value System (FundDropBox)**

### Description:
A secure donation box system where users can send Ether to the contract. The contract keeps track of each donor’s contributions and allows the founder to release funds to recipients.

### Key Functions:
- `dropFund()` – Accepts ETH from donors.
- `donorHistory(address supporter)` – Shows how much ETH a donor has contributed.
- `getPotStatus()` – Shows current balance of the fund.
